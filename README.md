# kickstarter-analysis
The Module 1 Challegne Assignment 
## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to present data on the different fundraising campaiqns and thier outcomes based on the factors of fundraising goals and the date of which they were launched. This was done in order to show how outcomes changed in relation to the difference in the two factors listed and to from that draw conclusions as to how that data showcases the effect those factors had on the different outcomes in the tested fundraising campaiqns.
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
When conducting the analysis for the outcomes of Fundraisers based on their launch date, the aproach that was taken was starting with properly sorting out the data for the dates into something that would be better suited for use in sorting the data for analysis and to that end the Year() function was used to better sort the dates listed in the data set. From there the next step was in taking the data and presenting it in shuch a way so as to see how it related to one another, to acomplish this a pivot table was created in order to showcase this data in way that could show any corelation in the data of Dates to outcomes of the campaiqns. The settingup of table used the settings showcased in![pivot_table_fields](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mhaus2001/kickstarter-analysis/main/pivot_table_fields.png) to create a pivot table which showed the outcome data for each month, with the months being in a column and the rows for each month showcased the number of outcomes and what those outcome were for that month[pivot_table](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mhaus2001/kickstarter-analysis/main/pivot_table.png). Finally to better visulaize the data a line chart was created from the pivot table sing the built in chart creation function within excel[Resources/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mhaus2001/kickstarter-analysis/resources/Resources/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png)
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
When conducting the anlysis for the outcomes on goals the process to present the data was conducted differently, since there was a needed to to create a table with entierley new compiled data a pivot table was not viable and as such the manuel creation of table was done and then filled out using formulas to compile data from the main data set. The way this was done was creating a formula, Confis(), which compilied data from the main data set, particularaly which fundraisers were succesful and whether they were plays(since that was the sample from the data set being used for this analsyis), and then setting the conditions in the equation specific to each, which seperated the data based on donation goals. In the end the formula looked like this[Confis_Formula](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mhaus2001/kickstarter-analysis/main/Confis_Formula.png). From that point the steps taken were in presting the rest of data in percentages to better showcase how the outcomes were distributed by goals for each row [Goals_table]((https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mhaus2001/kickstarter-analysis/main/Goals_table.png). Finally for better visulaization a line chart was created to show the trends throught the entirety of the data set [Resources/Outcomes_vs_Goals.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mhaus2001/kickstarter-analysis/resources/Resources/Resources/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png).
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
When looking at the challegnes and difficulties within conductng this anaysis the main point came not from the crafting or executing the formmulas and tables but in the results that were incorectly displayed due to incorect formating and sorting in the main data set in excell. The main example of this was shown when creating the table for the outcomes based on goals as due to formating error that occured in main data set the goals were ordered incorectly and as such were matched incorrectly to campaigns very harshly scewing the data away from the actual results. It devling into sorting multiple collums at once and using older versions of the sata set without the formating to set it back to its previous to correct the issue and allow the crafted formulas to drawupon the correct data so it could be properly and accuratly displayed. 
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
When looking at the results of the analysis conducted based on the Launch Date an important conclusion that can be drawn is through the trend exhibited within the data for which campaiqgns failed based on thier launch date, that trend being that there is very little variation based upon launch date as the amount of failures per month did not have any where near the variation that can be seen in the other part of this data. In looking at the success there is a much bigger shift in the data presented by the outcomes based on launch date, this is seen in the signifigant rise in sucesses of those campaigns launched during the summer months in comparison to those launched in the spring or fall.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
In looking at the data presented for the outcomes based on the fundraising goals the major conclusion that can be drawn from it is that campaiqns are not far mor likely to succed at lower goals and then even out in terms of possibilty of succes or failure before finally trending sharply towards failure after hitting a certain goal threshold. This data therefore showcases that the best possibilty of success came through setting lower fundraising goals and in setting higher goals the probabilty of failure increases.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Some of the limitations of the dataset used was the information used lacked data in what comprimsed the donations and backing to campaigns beyond the total numbers which could provide greater context in how goals may have been met or failed to do so. As well in looking at the analysis done having increased data on campaiqn sizes beyond just the goals set in what sized organizations were making the campaiqns would provide increased context to the data analysied.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Some other possibilties for graphs and charts that could be created would be ones such that look at outcomes based upon country the fundraising campaigns took place in to get geographical data. As well such a chart could be supported by looking at how goals compare to location in affecting whether a fundraising campaign would be more successful and such graphs would provide greater context to what the analysis done already has showcased in what affects the success of fundraising campaiqgns.
