# kickstarter-analysis
The Module 1 Challegne Assignment 
## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to present data on the different fundraising campaiqns and thier outcomes based on the factors of fundraising goals and the date of which they were launched. This was done in order to show how outcomes changed in relation to the difference in the two factors listed and to from that draw conclusions as to how that data showcases the effect those factors had on the different outcomes in the tested fundraising campaiqns.
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
When conducting the analysis for the outcomes of Fundraisers based on their launch date, the aproach that was taken
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
When looking at the results of the analysis conducted based on the Launch Date an important conclusion that can be drawn is through the trend exhibited within the data for which campaiqgns failed based on thier launch date, that trend being that there is very little variation based upon launch date as the amount of failures per month did not have any where near the variation that can be seen in the other part of this data. In looking at the success there is a much bigger shift in the data presented by the outcomes based on launch date, this is seen in the signifigant rise in sucesses of those campaigns launched during the summer months in comparison to those launched in the spring or fall.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
In looking at the data presented for the outcomes based on the fundraising goals the major conclusion that can be drawn from it is that campaiqns are not far mor likely to succed at lower goals and then even out in terms of possibilty of succes or failure before finally trending sharply towards failure after hitting a certain goal threshold. This data therefore showcases that the best possibilty of success came through setting lower fundraising goals and in setting higher goals the probabilty of failure increases.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Some of the limitations of the dataset used was the information used lacked data in what comprimsed the donations and backing to campaigns beyond the total numbers which could provide greater context in how goals may have been met or failed to do so. As well in looking at the analysis done having increased data on campaiqn sizes beyond just the goals set in what sized organizations were making the campaiqns would provide increased context to the data analysied.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Some other possibilties for graphs and charts that could be created would be ones such that look at outcomes based upon country the fundraising campaigns took place in to get geographical data. As well such a chart could be supported by looking at how goals compare to location in affecting whether a fundraising campaign would be more successful and such graphs would provide greater context to what the analysis done already has showcased in what affects the success of fundraising campaiqgns.
